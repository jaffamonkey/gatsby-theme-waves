Quality engineering is about improving quality across the project, not just dogmatically automating requirements tests.

With the challenges of many company cultures I have developed my own pragmatic approach to improving software quality - it's always possible.

## Test Engineering

It's all about what's appropriate. Sometimes investing is a feature-rich test framework is a good idea. But if you have the build pipepline in sights, then you had better make sure tests run as lean (fast) as possible.

```bash
$ npm install -g assert superagent

// test-api.js
const superagent = require('superagent');
const assert = require('assert');

superagent
  .get('http://localhost:3001/api/v1/todos')
  .end((err, res) => {
    assert.ifError(err);
    assert.equal(res.status, 200);
    console.log('Result: ' + res.text)
    });

$ node test-api.js
Result: {"success":"true","message":"todos retrieved successfully","todos":[{"id":1,"title":"example"}]}
```

Writing test code is easier, and there is a raft of packages to help you ... or hinder you. The API test is a very basic example, but step up to UI tests (with reporting) and already complexitiy increases.

More important that writing a lot of automated tests, is continually adapting and adding automated tests on-demand, to ensure the regular daily builds have quality control.

## Quality assurance

* Continual review of quality efforts, at all stages of the project pipeline.

## 
* Encourages the business to think outside of requirements, and understand the beenfits of an exploratory mindset.

## Coaching

* We can show your team how to do Quality Engineering, from the ground up with training that is customed to your project needs.

## Training courses

* We also provide training for more advanced software engineering coding and approaches.
* We can combine training with real project work,to maximise the value of the training.
