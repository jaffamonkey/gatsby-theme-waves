## Testing meets `DevOps`

It's all about what's appropriate, to both development and business sides to a project.

Sometimes investing is a feature-rich `Test framework` is a good idea, but starting small is always the best place to start.

But if you have integration with `CI`/`CD` in sight, then the tests run must be as lean (fast) as possible.

```bash
$ npm install -g assert superagent

// test-api.js
const superagent = require('superagent');
const assert = require('assert');

superagent
  .get('http://localhost:3001/api/v1/todos')
  .end((err, res) => {
    assert.ifError(err);
    assert.equal(res.status, 200);
    console.log('Result: ' + res.text)
    });

$ node test-api.js
Result: {"success":"true","message":
"todos retrieved successfully",
"todos":[{"id":1,"title":"example"}]}
```
## Native code or package?

Start with too many packages, then you will quickly end up with an unused test framework.

Start small - don't use a package if it can be coded natively.

Conversely, don't waste too much time on native code - packages are there too help you, just be selective.

```bash
$ npm install -g artillery
$ artillery quick -d 60 -r 10 -k https://jaffamonkey.netlify.com

```

## Load testing

You don't need to run a heavy `Load test` to get useful feedback.

Developers always appreciate feedback on performance impact from their code changes.

_Choose tools that do not add too much overhead  on the `Build server`, as ideally it should run as part of build checks._

```js
// pa11y-test.js
var config = {
    defaults: {
      screenCapture: './_pa11y-screen-capture.png',
      standard: 'WCAG2AA',
      ignore: [ 'notice' ]
    },
    urls: ['https://agitated-hawking-da0192.netlify.com/1']
  };
  function pa11yconfig(urls, defaults) {
    console.error('Env:', process.env.TEST_SRV);
    for (var idx = 0; idx < urls.length; idx++) {
      urls[ idx ] = urls[ idx ]
        .replace('${TEST_SRV}', process.env.TEST_SRV);
    }
    return {
      defaults: defaults,
      urls: urls
    }
  };
  module.exports = pa11yconfig (config.urls, config.defaults);

```

## Web accessibility

There are several `Web accessibility` tools that are easy to integrate as part of `CI`.

These tools will check against the `WCAG2` standards, but final evaluation should be with real users with real accessibility devices and software.

Implementing a tool to run automated checks across the web/mobile app will keep development on track.

_Keep with `CLI` tools, as this will ensure integration with the build pipeline will have less impact/overheads_

```bash
$ docker pull owasp/zap2docker-weekly
$ docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-api-scan.py \ 
  -t http://jaffamonkey.com -f openapi

```

## Security testing

There is a lot you can test client-side to avoid the more emabrassing security errors.

Common vulnerabilities are:

- SQL Injection
- Cross Site Scripting
- Cross Site Request Forgery
- Failure to restrict URL Access

```bash
sudo: required
dist: trusty
addons:
  chrome: stable
language: node_js
node_js:
  - '11'
branches:
  only:
  - travis-ci
before_script:
  - npm install chromedriver 
  - npm selenium-webdriver
script:
  - node test.js
```

## DevOps

Here are some ways that `Test engineering` easily helps with `DevOps`

- `Dockerise` your test framework (better portability and ease of running).
- Keep package-count low, and specify versions so pointless updates do not occur.
- Ensure processes are properly "killed" at the end of test runs.
- Use cloud service to store historical reports and other test artifacts (like screenshots)
