I am lucky enough to enjoy the work I do, and still feel inspired to learn.

I have moved in world of tech and creative for over 22 years, on many projects which has given me a flexible, open approach.

I have provided Quality Assurance and Test Engineering services to over 56 companies, ranging from groundbreaking startups to companies in stage of chaos.

The technical side is something I enjoy, but more so engaging with different challenges.

I will not judge your team or company, and take pride in bringing better quality to web and mobile apps.
