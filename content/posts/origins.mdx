#### I am lucky enough to enjoy the work I do, and still inspired to learn.

I was not born into testing world, I didn't take first steps into tech until 1993. My first testing contract was offered to me by the company that had contracted me for 3rd line Oracle application support work, but that had dried up. Testing was pretty mind-numbing work in the late 90's - heavy on analysis documentation, heavy of reporting, and arch-lever files everywhere (there was always someone who wanted the whole damn lot printed out). As for test automation, these were the more challenging days of off-the-shelf third-party software, sold with gusto and commonly sold with the classic line "Do more with less code!". 

But I enjoy working as part of the team, be it in management or technical capacity. And I enjoy the challenge of testing - the broad skills remit, the constant skills updating and dealing with negativity. My ADHD made being an actual developer a struggle, but proved to be an asset in testing. I do not mean lack of focus, I mean the ability to manage many business and technical tasks, and a mindset always ready to change/adapt. 

I have moved in world of tech and creative for over 22 years, on many projects which has given me a flexible, open approach. Half my career has been in QA/Test management, the other in Test engineering and DevOps.  I have provided Quality assurance and Test engineering services to over 56 companies. These ranged from groundbreaking startups to companies in stages of chaos. 

_I will not judge your team or company, and take pride in bringing better quality to web and mobile apps._
