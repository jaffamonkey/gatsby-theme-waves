> *****_A quote from an Agile test coach, bemused how I had managed a long career in testing world, but patently failed to pointlessly market myself at humblebragging conferences or on social media ;)_

Half my career has been in `QA` and `Test management`(RIP), the latter half focused on `Test engineering` and `DevOps`. Although the skills most frequently utilised are my technical skills, I also bring a Quality assurance mindset. I have provided Quality assurance and Test engineering services to over 50 companies since 1997. These ranged from groundbreaking startups to companies in stages of chaos. 

I was part of the initial rollout of `MMS` and `Mobile video` services with `o2`/`Nokia`, I managed testing at `BBC Technology` during their huge transition to digital media and coordinated efforts at publishers like `Emap` and `Incisive Media` implementing cenralised content management systems. 

I was not born into testing world, I didn't take first steps into tech until 1993 with a practical BTEC HND. After a grotty foot-in-the-door contract on a Windows 95 helpdesk, I have moved in world of tech and creative for over 22 years, on over 100 projects. It has given me a flexible, open approach - I never make any assumptions project-to-project.  

My first testing contract was offered to me by the company that had contracted me for 3rd line Oracle application support work, but that had dried up. Testing was pretty mind-numbing work in the late 90's - heavy on analysis documentation, heavy of reporting, and arch-lever files everywhere (there was always someone who wanted the whole damn lot printed out). As for test automation, these were the more challenging days of off-the-shelf third-party software, sold with gusto and commonly sold with the classic line "Do more with less code!". 

But I enjoy working as part of the team, be it in management or technical capacity. And I enjoy the challenge of testing - the broad skills remit, the constant skills updating and dealing with negativity. My particular challenges with `ADHD` made being an actual developer a struggle, but proved to be an asset in testing. I do not mean lack of focus, I mean the ability to manage many business and technical tasks, and a mindset always ready to change/adapt.
