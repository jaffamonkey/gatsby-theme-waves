### The rush to automate CI/CD pipelines can leave some behind.

For the client, `feature` completion of the feature is the success, but the path can easily get skewed.

Getting a shared view of the journey of a feature through the project pipeline from the outset, will smooth the daily work.

Quality assurance has unique vantage point on a project, and quality is of interest to everyone.

_Remember that just because the `CI`/`CD` pipelines are working well, it does not mean it is doing the right job_

### How Quality assurance can help

#### Definition of Done

Everyone has a common ideas of what sensibly indicates feature is "Done".

However, everyone has subtle variations on those common ideas.

Is it worth dissecting the `DoD` to this level? No.

Features as they were defined for signoff, will morph or completely vanish.

The DoD should be foremost, practical.

```gherkin
Feature: As a user, I want a helpful search page, so I can find relevant results quickly
  
  Scenario: Test searching (happy path)
    Given I perform search for "BDD" 
    When I filter search results to display only result containing word "Gherkin"
    And order search results by relevance
    Then the first search result should contain "Gherkin" in the result title

  Scenario: Testing searching (unhappy path)
    Given I perform search for "BDDD" 
    Then I should see search suggestion "Did you mean BDD?"
    When I successfully follow the search suggestion
    And I filter search results to display only result containing word "Gherkin"
    And order search results by relevance
    Then the first search result should contain "Gherkin" in the result title
```

#### Requirements

Encourage the `products owner` or `business analyst` to adopt different approach to requirements.

One approach is using `specification by example` approach to defining user stories.

This approach encourages people to think their user story through, rather than just high level view.

The process of giving examples to illustrate what they want, gives the developers more direction.

And provides a better basis for creating acceptance tests.

#### Continual improvement

Continual review of quality efforts, at all stages of the project pipeline.

This is where conversation needs to occur on a daily basis, but not in an alarmist fashion.

Every process, every way of working should be up for review - and most importantly the team should feel they can be honest.

There is no space for complacency, only the healthy assumption that change is not a risk - it's normal.

If a change to a process doesn't show signs of improving within a Sprint, then adapt/change.
