### The rush to automate CI/CD pipelines can leave some behind.

If not documented will be difficult for new people to pick up.

The important stage is what is fed into the pipeline, i.e. requirements.

For the client, completed requirements are the benchmark of success BUT success criteria has to be agreed by consensus.

_Remember that just because a CI/CD pipeline is working well, it does not mean it is doing a good job_ 

```gherkin
    ✅ Person A is not happy but doesn't care, so is happy
    ✅ Person B is happy
    ✅ Person C is fooled into being happy
    ✅ Person D is happy but, that has nothing to do with the Sprint demo
    ✅ Person E is most critical signoff member who is never around
    ✅ Person F ...
```
### How Quality assurance can help

#### Definition of Done

Everyone has a common ideas of what sensibly indicates feature is "Done".

However, everyone has subtle variations on those common ideas.

Is it worth dissecting the DoD to this level? No.

Features as they were defined for signoff, will morph or completely vanish.

The DoD should be foremost, practical.

```gherkin
Feature: Testing the test website
  
  Scenario: Testing searching
    Given I am on test website homepage
    And I fill in the search field with "donald trump simulator"
    When I click the search button
    And the page title is "donald trump simulator site:github.com at DuckDuckGo"
    Then the first search result should contain "Donald Trump"
```

#### Requirements

Encourage Products Owners to adopt different approach to requirements.

One approach is using `specification by example` approach to defining user stories.

This approach encourages Business analysts and product Owners to think their user story through.

The process of giving examples to illustrate what they want, gives the developers more direction.

And provides a better basis for creating acceptance tests.

```
#### Continual improvement

Continual review of quality efforts, at all stages of the project pipeline.

This is where conversation needs to occur on a daily basis, but not in an alrmist fashion.

Every process, every way of working should be up for review - and most importantly the team should feel they can be honest.

There is no space for complacency, only the healthy assumption that change is not a risk - it's normal.

If a change to a process doesn't show signs of improving within a Sprint, then adapt/change.
