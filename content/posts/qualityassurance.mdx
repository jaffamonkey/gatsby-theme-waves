What an Agile coach/consultant does, was always covered in Quality assurance remit (without the Lego, and bug-hunt fun days). (Software) quality assurance means monitoring quality of the methods and approaches used in producing software.

### And it's about people

Engaging with ideas such as transparency and supportive teams, will never work unless people can be themselves, not the default front we show in an office where talking in a non-natural way is standard.

Until you give people the space to be themselves, you are simply playing the same game of old (management). 
 
The new project management skill (if it is management at all) is maintaining momentum with a group of individuals with complete freedom to express themselves. It's a challenge but a worthwhile one.

### The rush to automate CI/CD pipelines can leave some behind.

For the client, `feature` completion of the feature is the success, but the path can easily get skewed.

Getting a shared view of the journey of a feature through the project pipeline from the outset, will smooth the daily work.

Quality assurance has unique vantage point on a project, and quality is of interest to everyone.

_Remember that just because the `CI`/`CD` pipelines are working well, it does not mean it is doing the right job_ 

```jsx
* I want it to look nice
* I want to see animations
* I want to be happy with it
* I want the acceptance tests to pass
* I want the stakeholders to be happy
* I want them to overlook something we missed
* I want to decide when it's done
* I want it to be exactly like first agreed
* I want it with all my adhoc suggestions
* I want more exploratory testing
* I don't care
* ...
```

### Definition of Done

Everyone has a common ideas of what sensibly indicates feature is "Done". However, everyone has also subtle variations on what they consider to be "Done", and this comprise of most of the disagreements.

Is it worth dissecting the `DoD` to a granular level to please everyone? No - keep it pragmatic.

Feature signoff is a moment in time, and an important benchmark for the business. But the feature will quickly change/morph as development and new feature-related requirements appear in the backlog.

```gherkin
Feature: As a user, 
         I want a helpful search page, 
         so I can find relevant results quickly
  
Scenario: Test searching (happy path)
  Given I perform search for "BDD" 
  When I filter results containing "Gherkin"
  And order search results by relevance
  Then first result title contains "Gherkin"

Scenario: Testing searching (unhappy path)
  Given I perform search for "BDDD" 
  Then suggestion "Did you mean BDD?" displayed
```

### Requirements

The user story format can be vague, so encoruage the `products owner` or `business analyst` to adopt different approach to requirements. Sometimes people just need to be shown a direction, to change.

One approach is using `specification by example` approach to defining user stories. This approach encourages people to think their user story through, rather than just high level view.

The process of giving examples to illustrate what they want, gives the developers more direction. And provides a better basis for creating acceptance tests.

+----------------+      +----------------------+
```

### Continual improvement

All quality efforts, at all stages of the project pipeline, should regularly be reviewed.

Every process, every way of working has potential for improvement, or perhaps even losing

_Importantly, the team should feel they can be honest._

There is no space for complacency, only the healthy assumption that change is not a risk - it's normal.

If a change to a process doesn't show signs of improving within a Sprint, then adapt/change.
