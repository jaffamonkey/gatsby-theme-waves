## Continual improvement

Continual review of quality efforts, at all stages of the project pipeline.

The rush to automate CI/CD pipelines can leave some behind, and if not documented will be difficult for new people to pick up.

The important stage is what is fed into the pipeline, which is what people expect as a result - and this will differ!

Encouraging the business to think outside of simple user stories is a good first step.

_Remember that just because a CI/CD pipeline is working well, it does not mean it is doing a good job_
