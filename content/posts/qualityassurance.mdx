## Continual improvement

The rush to automate CI/CD pipelines can leave some behind, and if not documented will be difficult for new people to pick up.

The important stage is what is fed into the pipeline, which is what people expect as a result - and this will differ!

Encouraging the business to think outside of simple user stories is a good first step.

_Remember that just because a CI/CD pipeline is working well, it does not mean it is doing a good job_ 

```gherkin
Feature: Testing the test website
  
  Scenario: Testing searching
    Given I am on test website homepage
    And I fill in the search field with "donald trump simulator"
    When I click the search button
    And the page title is "donald trump simulator site:github.com at DuckDuckGo"
    Then the first search result should contain "Donald Trump"
```

## First steps

Some areas that will benefit from Quality assurance expertise:

* Definition of Done -simple principles, and yet commonly over-complicated.
* Encourage Products Owners to adopt different approach to requirements.
* Keep areas such as security, load, accessibility and browser/device compatibility in focus early on.
* Continual review of quality efforts, at all stages of the project pipeline.
