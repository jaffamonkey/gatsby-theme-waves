What an Agile coach/consultant does, was always covered in Quality assurance remit (without the Lego, and bug-hunt fun days). (Software) quality assurance means monitoring the methods and approaches used in producing software, to ensure quality. Even if you just need a days review, you will be surprised how many improvements can be made.

### The rush to automate CI/CD pipelines can leave some behind.

For the client, `feature` completion of the feature is the success, but the path can easily get skewed.

Getting a shared view of the journey of a feature through the project pipeline from the outset, will smooth the daily work.

Quality assurance has unique vantage point on a project, and quality is of interest to everyone.

_Remember that just because the `CI`/`CD` pipelines are working well, it does not mean it is doing the right job_

### It's about people

Engaging with ideas such as transparency and supportive teams, will never work unless the work environment demontsrates this in action.

Firstly: Focus on tasks, not roles - surprisingly how quickly most most assumptions. An individual will have skills outside of a role, so immediately you are limiting the individuals potential contribution.

Secondly: Humans make mistakes, get upset, get stressed - and these are things easy to alleviate, but not with meetings and process. Foster an environment that allows people to take more risks, point out concerns and make suggestions.


```markdown
                  +----------+
                  | FEATURE  |
                  +----+-----+
                       |
                +------v-------+      
+--------+      |   STAGING    |       
| REVIEW <---fail  SMOKE TEST  |
+--------+      +-----pass-----+
                        |
  +---------------------v-------------------+
  | ☑ Product Owner validated feature       |
  | ☑ Acceptance test has passed on staging |
  | ☑ No WCAG2AA accessbility errors        |
  | ☑ Feature UAT passed on staging         |
  | ☑ Feature is ready for live deployment  |
  +-----------------------------------------+
```

### Definition of Done

Everyone has a common ideas of what sensibly indicates feature is "Done". However, everyone has also subtle variations on what they consider to be "Done", and this comprise of most of the disagreements.

Is it worth dissecting the `DoD` to a granular level to please everyone? No - keep it pragmatic.

Feature signoff is a moment in time, and an important benchmark for the business. But the feature will quickly change/morph as development and new feature-related requirements appear in the backlog.

```gherkin
Feature: As a user, 
         I want a helpful search page, 
         so I can find relevant results quickly
  
Scenario: Test searching (happy path)
  Given I perform search for "BDD" 
  When I filter results containing "Gherkin"
  And order search results by relevance
  Then first result title contains "Gherkin"

Scenario: Testing searching (unhappy path)
  Given I perform search for "BDDD" 
  Then suggestion "Did you mean BDD?" displayed
```

### Requirements

The user story format can be vague, so encoruage the `products owner` or `business analyst` to adopt different approach to requirements. Sometimes people just need to be shown a direction, to change.

One approach is using `specification by example` approach to defining user stories. This approach encourages people to think their user story through, rather than just high level view.

The process of giving examples to illustrate what they want, gives the developers more direction. And provides a better basis for creating acceptance tests.

```markdown

| quations from  |      | ensure we have their |
| developers     |      | time when essential  |
+----------------+      +----------------------+
```

### Continual improvement

All quality efforts, at all stages of the project pipeline, should regularly be reviewed.

Every process, every way of working has potential for improvement, or perhaps even losing

_Importantly, the team should feel they can be honest._

There is no space for complacency, only the healthy assumption that change is not a risk - it's normal.

If a change to a process doesn't show signs of improving within a Sprint, then adapt/change.
