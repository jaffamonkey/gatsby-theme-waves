## Coaching

We can show your team how use Quality Engineering the improve ways of working. 

The training that is customed to your project needs, covering beginners or more advanced practitioners.

We also provide training for more advanced software engineering coding techniques.

We can combine training with real project work, to maximise the value of the training.

```markdown
* Create a GitHub Repo
* Code HTML page
* Start a basic web server
* Code a UI test
* Create Travis build script
* Deploy on Netlify
```

## Training courses

Here is an online workshop for test engineering beginners, that covers the entire pipeline from coding to deployment.

Part of the “zero to vanilla quality engineer” workshop (zero, as in zero prior knowledge)
