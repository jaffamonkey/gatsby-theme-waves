#### We can show your team how use Quality Engineering the improve ways of working. 

The training that is customed to your project needs, covering beginners or more advanced practitioners.

We also provide training for more advanced software engineering coding techniques.

We can combine training with real project work, to maximise the value of the training.

### Training courses

Here is an online workshop for test engineering beginners that I desgined from several pretegees.

The intention is to cover the entire pipeline from coding to deployment.

While testing skills are important, learning them in context of project as a whole is benefifical and will help testers integrate into teams better. 

Part of the “zero to vanilla quality engineer” workshop (zero, as in zero prior knowledge)
