### I can show your team how use Quality Engineering the improve ways of working. 

The training that is customed to your project needs, covering beginners or more advanced practitioners. I also provide training for more advanced software engineering coding techniques.

### Workshops

Here is an online workshop for test engineering beginners that I designed for my protegees.

> * Coding a basic HTML page that we will use for testing.
* Introduction to the source control system (GitHub)
* Coding an automated test
* Configuring test run on the build server.
* How to deploy the new website to live

The intention is to cover the entire pipeline from coding to deployment.

While testing skills are important, learning them in context of project as a whole is benefifical and will help testers integrate into teams better.
