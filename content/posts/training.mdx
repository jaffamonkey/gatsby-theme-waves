### Workshops

Here is an online workshop for test engineering beginners that I desgined from several pretegees.

The intention is to cover the entire pipeline from coding to deployment.

While testing skills are important, learning them in context of project as a whole is benefifical and will help testers integrate into teams better. 

Part of the “zero to vanilla quality engineer” workshop (zero, as in zero prior knowledge)
