# Quality assurance

### What an Agile coach/consultant does, was always covered in Quality assurance remit (without the Lego, and bug-hunt fun days)

<DeckWave deck="decks/hi">

### And it's about people

Engaging with ideas such as transparency and supportive teams, will never work unless people can be themselves. The new project management skill (if it is management at all) is maintaining momentum with a group of individuals with complete freedom to express themselves. It's a challenge but a worthwhile one.

### CI/CD pipelines

The rush to automate `CI`/`CD` pipelines can leave some behind - but for the `Product owner`, `Feature` completion is the success benchmark.

But the path of developing that feature can easily get skewed in the path to buisness acceptance.

Getting a shared view of the journey of a `Feature` through the project pipeline from the outset, will smooth the daily work.

`Quality assurance` has unique vantage point on a project, and quality is of interest to everyone.

_Remember that just because the `CI`/`CD` pipelines are working well, it does not mean it is doing the right job_

```jsx
* I want it to look nice
* I want to see animations
* I want to be happy with it
* I want the acceptance tests to pass
* I want the stakeholders to be happy
* I want them to overlook something we missed
* I want to decide when it's done
* I want it to be exactly like first agreed
* I want it with all my adhoc suggestions
* I want more exploratory testing
* I don't care
* ...
```

### Definition of Done

Everyone has a common idea of what sensibly indicates when a `Feature` is "Done". 

However, everyone has also subtle variations on what they consider to be "Done".

Is it worth dissecting the `DoD` to a granular level to please everyone? No - keep it pragmatic.

`Feature` signoff is a moment in time, and an important benchmark for the business. 

But the feature will quickly change/morph as development and new feature-related requirements appear in the `Backlog`.

### Requirements

The `User story` format can be vague, so encourage the `Product owner` or `Business analyst` to adopt different approach to requirements. Sometimes people just need to be shown a direction, to change the way they work.

One approach is using `Specification by example` approach to defining user stories. 

This approach encourages people to think their user story through, rather than just high level view.

The process of giving examples to illustrate what they want, gives the developers more direction. 

It provides a better basis for creating acceptance tests.

### Continual improvement

All quality efforts, at all stages of the project pipeline, should regularly be reviewed.

Every process, every way of working has potential for improvement, or perhaps even losing it alltogether.

_Importantly, the team should feel they can be honest._

The healthy assumption that change is not a risk, it's normality and simply illustratvie of how humans learn and adapt.

In Agile space, Far too much time is spent analysing our own (human) behaviour - it's a Groundhog day.

If a change to a process doesn't show signs of improving within a `Sprint`, then adapt/change.
